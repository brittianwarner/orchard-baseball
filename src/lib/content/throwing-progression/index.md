# Throwing Progression

This structured throwing progression is designed to help players of all ages develop proper throwing mechanics while safely building arm strength. Follow each step in order, respecting the time limits to ensure a complete and effective throwing routine.

## Getting Started

### Safety

Before beginning any throwing progression, ensure:

- Players are properly warmed up with dynamic stretching
- No signs of arm pain or soreness are present
- Weather conditions are appropriate
- A coach or supervisor is monitoring technique

### Partner Up

- Find a partner of similar age/ability
- Stand facing each other at the prescribed distance
- Make eye contact before each throw
- Focus on proper mechanics over speed/distance

## Progression Steps

### On Two Knees

#### Elbow on Glove Flip (60 seconds)

- Position: Both players on two knees, approximately 5 feet apart
- Technique: Place throwing elbow on glove, focus on wrist action only
- Motion: Flip the baseball to partner using only wrist action
- Focus: Proper grip, wrist snap, and accuracy

#### Two-Knee Throw and Fall (60 seconds)

- Position: Both players on two knees, 15-20 feet apart
- Technique: Full arm motion while staying on knees
- Motion: Throw and fall forward after release (chest toward target)
- Focus: Upper body rotation and follow-through

### On One Knee

#### Throwing-Hand Knee Down (60 seconds)

- Position: Throwing-hand knee down, 15-20 feet apart
- Technique: Exaggerated throwing motion
- Motion: Complete throw and finish with chest to knee
- Focus: Hip rotation and proper shoulder alignment

### Standing Throws

#### Feet Stationary Figure Eight (60 seconds)

- Position: Standing 30 feet apart, feet stationary
- Technique: Throw using figure-eight arm motion
- Motion: Emphasize proper arm path and follow-through
- Focus: Arm slot and consistent release point

#### Normal Throw at 30 Feet (60 seconds)

- Position: Standard throwing position, 30 feet apart
- Technique: Normal throwing motion with proper mechanics
- Motion: Complete lower and upper body mechanics
- Focus: Integration of full-body throwing motion

#### Normal Throw at 45 Feet (60 seconds)

- Position: 45 feet apart
- Technique: Same as 30 feet, slightly more effort
- Focus: Maintaining mechanics with increased distance

#### Normal Throw at 60 Feet (60 seconds)

- Position: Regulation baseball distance (60 feet)
- Technique: Full throwing motion with proper mechanics
- Focus: Accuracy and consistent arm speed

#### Normal Throw at 90 Feet (60 seconds)

- Position: 90 feet apart
- Technique: Increase arm speed while maintaining mechanics
- Focus: Long arm swing and proper follow-through

#### Normal Throw at 120 Feet (60 seconds)

- Position: 120 feet apart
- Technique: Long toss mechanics with slight arc on throw
- Focus: Using legs and core to generate distance

### Finishing Sequence

#### Easy Semi-Long Toss

- Position: Maximum comfortable distance
- Technique: Keep the ball high with slight arc
- Focus: Distance without maximum effort

#### Coming Back In

- Activity: Gradually reduce distance back to 60 feet
- Technique: Maintain high throws with arc
- Focus: Control effort level while reducing distance

#### Quick Hands, Quick Feet (60 seconds)

- Position: 60 feet apart
- Technique: Rapid transfer from catch to throw
- Motion: Quick footwork aligned with target
- Focus: Fielding position transition to throwing position

## Coaching Points

- Enforce proper mechanics at every stage
- Monitor players for signs of fatigue or discomfort
- Adjust distances for younger players as needed
- Entire progression should take 12-15 minutes
- Can be used as daily warmup before practice or games
