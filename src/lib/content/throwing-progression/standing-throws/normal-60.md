# Normal Throw at 60 Feet

This drill practices throws at the standard baseball diamond distance (60 feet/18.3 meters), which is the distance between bases. This represents a practical game distance that players will frequently use.

## Setup

**Duration**: 60 seconds
**Distance**: 60 feet apart
**Position**: Standing, facing partner with proper throwing stance

## Execution

1. **Starting Position**:
   - Stand facing your partner at 60 feet distance
   - Feet in athletic position, weight balanced
   - Hold the baseball with a four-seam grip
2. **Throwing Motion**:
   - Step toward your target with your glove-side foot
   - Generate power from lower body through proper hip rotation
   - Execute full arm action with appropriate arm speed
   - Follow through completely with arm and body
   - Maintain direct line to target throughout motion
3. **Reset**:
   - Field your partner's return throw
   - Return to starting position
   - Prepare for the next throw

## Coaching Points

### Proper Technique

- **Power Generation**: Use legs and core to generate throwing power
- **Arm Action**: Full arm circle with proper elbow position
- **Timing**: Synchronize lower and upper body movements
- **Follow Through**: Complete throwing motion with chest over front knee
- **Balance**: Maintain balance throughout the throwing motion
- **Accuracy**: Focus on hitting partner's chest area consistently

### Common Errors to Avoid

- Throwing with excessive upper body/minimal lower body
- Rushing mechanics to generate more power
- Dropping arm angle to push the ball
- Poor direction toward target with front foot
- Inconsistent release point affecting accuracy

### Progression Goals

- Achieve game-speed throws at standard baseball distance
- Reinforce mechanics that will be used in gameplay
- Build consistent accuracy at practical distance
- Develop appropriate effort level for this distance
- Prepare arm for longer distance throws in next phases

## Why This Matters

The 60-foot distance is particularly significant as it matches the distance between bases on a baseball diamond. Throws at this distance simulate many game situations, including throws between infielders, from catcher to second base, and shorter outfield throws.

By practicing at this standard distance, players develop muscle memory for the most common throwing distance they'll encounter in games. The mechanical habits formed at this distance directly translate to game performance.

After 60 seconds of normal throws at 60 feet, partners will step back to 90 feet for the next phase of the progression, challenging players to maintain mechanics at longer distances.
