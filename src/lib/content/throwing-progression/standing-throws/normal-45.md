# Normal Throw at 45 Feet

This drill continues the distance progression with full throwing mechanics at 45 feet, an intermediate distance that challenges players to maintain proper form with slightly increased effort.

## Setup

**Duration**: 60 seconds
**Distance**: 45 feet apart
**Position**: Standing, facing partner with proper throwing stance

## Execution

1. **Starting Position**:
   - Stand facing your partner at 45 feet distance
   - Feet in athletic position, weight slightly on back foot
   - Hold the baseball with a four-seam grip
2. **Throwing Motion**:
   - Step toward your target with your glove-side foot
   - Rotate hips and shoulders in proper sequence
   - Execute full arm action with proper mechanics
   - Follow through completely with arm and body
   - Maintain balance and control throughout
3. **Reset**:
   - Field your partner's return throw
   - Return to starting position
   - Prepare for the next throw

## Coaching Points

### Proper Technique

- **Consistent Mechanics**: Same fundamentals as 30-foot throws
- **Arm Speed**: Slight increase in arm speed, but still controlled
- **Direction**: Maintain direct line to target with step
- **Balance**: Stay balanced throughout the throwing motion
- **Follow Through**: Complete body follow-through
- **Accuracy**: Focus on hitting partner's chest/glove

### Common Errors to Avoid

- Overthrowing due to increased distance
- Dropping elbow to generate more power
- Opening up too early in throwing motion
- "Aiming" rather than throwing naturally
- Rushing mechanics due to increased effort

### Progression Goals

- Maintain consistent mechanics at increased distance
- Develop slightly more arm strength
- Build throwing endurance
- Continue reinforcing proper weight transfer and follow-through
- Adjust effort level appropriately for distance

## Why This Matters

The 45-foot distance represents an important step in the throwing progression, as it requires slightly more effort than the 30-foot distance but is still manageable for maintaining proper mechanics. This intermediate distance helps players gradually build arm strength while reinforcing fundamental throwing mechanics.

This stage helps players understand how to make minor adjustments to throwing effort without sacrificing mechanical integrity. The skills developed at this distance directly translate to both infield and shorter outfield throws in game situations.

After 60 seconds of normal throws at 45 feet, partners will step back to 60 feet (standard baseball diamond distance) for the next phase of the progression.
