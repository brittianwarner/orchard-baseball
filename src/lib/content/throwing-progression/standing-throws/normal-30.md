# Normal Throw at 30 Feet

This drill introduces full throwing mechanics at a comfortable distance, allowing players to integrate upper and lower body movement into a complete throwing motion.

## Setup

**Duration**: 60 seconds
**Distance**: 30 feet apart
**Position**: Standing, facing partner with proper throwing stance

## Execution

1. **Starting Position**:
   - Stand facing your partner at 30 feet distance
   - Feet should be shoulder-width apart in an athletic position
   - Hold the baseball with a four-seam grip
   - Weight slightly on back foot
2. **Throwing Motion**:
   - Begin by stepping toward your target with your glove-side foot
   - Rotate your hips and shoulders during the throw
   - Execute a full arm action with proper mechanics
   - Follow through completely with your throwing arm
   - Allow momentum to bring your back foot forward after release
3. **Reset**:
   - Catch your partner's return throw
   - Return to the starting position
   - Prepare for the next throw

## Coaching Points

### Proper Technique

- **Footwork**: Step directly toward target with glove-side foot
- **Hip Rotation**: Hips begin the kinetic chain, rotating before shoulders
- **Shoulder Rotation**: Upper body follows hip rotation
- **Arm Angle**: Maintain proper arm angle throughout motion
- **Follow Through**: Complete follow-through with arm and body
- **Balance**: Maintain balance throughout the throw

### Common Errors to Avoid

- Stepping in the wrong direction
- Throwing with "all arm" (minimal body rotation)
- Opening up too early in the throwing motion
- Insufficient follow-through
- Poor balance during or after the throw

### Progression Goals

- Develop complete throwing mechanics
- Integrate lower and upper body movement
- Establish proper timing between hip and shoulder rotation
- Build consistency in mechanics at a comfortable distance

## Why This Matters

The normal throw at 30 feet marks the first time in the progression where players use complete throwing mechanics. This distance is close enough to ensure accuracy and control while allowing full body mechanics to be incorporated.

This drill builds the foundation for all remaining throws in the progression. By establishing proper mechanics at this distance, players can gradually increase throwing distance while maintaining the same fundamental movement patterns.

After 60 seconds of normal throws at 30 feet, partners will step back to 45 feet for the next phase of the progression, where the same mechanics will be applied at a greater distance.
