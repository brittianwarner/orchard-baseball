# Figure Eight Throwing

This drill introduces standing throws while focusing on proper arm path and hand position. The figure eight motion helps establish proper arm action without the complexity of full body mechanics.

## Setup

**Duration**: 60 seconds
**Distance**: 30 feet apart
**Position**: Standing with feet stationary, facing partner

## Execution

1. **Starting Position**:
   - Stand facing your partner at 30 feet distance
   - Feet should be shoulder-width apart, stationary throughout the drill
   - Hold the baseball with a four-seam grip
2. **Throwing Motion**:
   - Begin the throw by making a figure-eight pattern with your throwing arm
   - As your arm comes forward, maintain proper mechanics through release
   - Keep your feet planted throughout the throw (no step)
   - Follow through with your arm after release
   - Focus on proper arm path rather than velocity
3. **Reset**:
   - Catch your partner's return throw
   - Reset to the starting position without moving your feet
   - Repeat the figure-eight motion

## Coaching Points

### Proper Technique

- **Figure Eight Path**: Throwing arm should trace a loose figure-eight pattern
- **Arm Action**: Smooth, fluid motion without hitches
- **Stationary Base**: Feet remain planted throughout the throw
- **Hand Position**: Maintain proper position with fingers on top at release
- **Follow Through**: Complete arm follow-through despite stationary feet

### Common Errors to Avoid

- Moving feet during the throw
- Rigid arm action instead of fluid figure-eight motion
- Short-arming the throw (abbreviated arm action)
- Improper hand position at release
- Minimal follow-through after release

### Progression Goals

- Develop proper arm path and action
- Establish consistent release point
- Build arm strength from standing position
- Create muscle memory for proper hand/arm position throughout throw

## Why This Matters

The figure-eight throwing drill isolates arm action while introducing a standing position. By keeping the feet stationary, players can focus exclusively on proper arm path without the added variables of footwork and lower body mechanics.

This drill serves as an important transition between stationary knee throws and full-motion standing throws. The figure-eight pattern helps establish fluid arm action and proper hand position throughout the throwing motion, which is essential for accuracy and arm health.

After completing 60 seconds of this drill, partners will progress to normal throws at the same distance, incorporating more complete throwing mechanics.
