# Normal Throw at 90 Feet

This phase of the throwing progression moves to 90 feet, challenging players to maintain proper mechanics while increasing arm strength. This distance represents typical longer infield throws and shorter outfield throws.

## Setup

**Duration**: 60 seconds
**Distance**: 90 feet apart
**Position**: Standing, facing partner with proper throwing stance

## Execution

1. **Starting Position**:
   - Stand facing your partner at 90 feet distance
   - Feet in athletic position, weight balanced
   - Hold the baseball with a four-seam grip
2. **Throwing Motion**:
   - Use a slightly longer stride toward target
   - Generate increased power from lower half
   - Maintain consistent arm path and slot
   - Follow through completely with full body
   - Emphasize lower body drive and rotation
3. **Reset**:
   - Field your partner's return throw
   - Return to starting position
   - Prepare for the next throw

## Coaching Points

### Proper Technique

- **Stride Length**: Slightly longer than at shorter distances
- **Weight Transfer**: Efficient energy transfer from lower to upper body
- **Arm Path**: Consistent arm action despite increased distance
- **Release Point**: Consistent release point with proper hand position
- **Follow Through**: Enhanced follow-through with longer arm extension
- **Trajectory**: Slightly flatter trajectory than shorter throws

### Common Errors to Avoid

- Throwing at maximum effort too early in progression
- Upper body tilt back to generate power
- Lowering arm slot to push the ball
- Inconsistent release point affecting accuracy
- Rushing mechanics to generate more power

### Progression Goals

- Build arm strength for longer distance throws
- Maintain mechanical integrity despite distance increase
- Develop proper effort calibration
- Improve accuracy at longer distance
- Prepare arm for next distance increment

## Why This Matters

The 90-foot distance represents important game scenarios, such as throws from third base to first base or outfielders throwing to cutoff positions. This distance requires increased arm strength while still demanding accuracy.

By maintaining proper mechanics at this increased distance, players learn how to generate more power effectively without sacrificing technique. This phase bridges the gap between standard infield distances and longer outfield throws.

After 60 seconds of normal throws at 90 feet, partners will move back to 120 feet for the final distance phase of the progression, further challenging arm strength while maintaining proper mechanics.
