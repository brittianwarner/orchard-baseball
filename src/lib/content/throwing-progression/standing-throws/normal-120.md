# Normal Throw at 120 Feet

This is the final distance phase of the throwing progression before moving to semi-long toss. At 120 feet, players are challenged to maintain proper mechanics while generating significant arm strength, simulating longer outfield throws.

## Setup

**Duration**: 60 seconds
**Distance**: 120 feet apart
**Position**: Standing, facing partner with proper throwing stance

## Execution

1. **Starting Position**:
   - Stand facing your partner at 120 feet distance
   - Feet in athletic position, weight balanced
   - Hold the baseball with a four-seam grip
2. **Throwing Motion**:
   - Use an aggressive but controlled stride
   - Generate maximum power from lower body
   - Maintain consistent arm path despite distance
   - Full hip and shoulder rotation for power
   - Complete follow-through with full body extension
   - Throw with a slightly higher trajectory when needed
3. **Reset**:
   - Field your partner's return throw
   - Return to starting position
   - Prepare for the next throw

## Coaching Points

### Proper Technique

- **Power Generation**: Maximize lower body drive
- **Arm Path**: Maintain consistent mechanics despite increased effort
- **Trajectory**: Slight arc, higher than shorter distance throws
- **Footwork**: Longer, more aggressive stride
- **Follow Through**: Full extension of arm and rotation of body
- **Recovery**: Balanced position after throw completion

### Common Errors to Avoid

- Overthrowing at expense of mechanics
- Excessive upper body lean back
- Dropping arm slot to generate distance
- Stepping offline due to overexertion
- Poor follow-through due to fatigue
- Rushing mechanics to generate power

### Progression Goals

- Build maximum functional arm strength
- Maintain mechanical integrity at long distance
- Develop feel for appropriate trajectory
- Improve accuracy at challenging distance
- Prepare for semi-long toss phase

## Why This Matters

The 120-foot distance represents typical outfield throws to cutoff men or longer infield throws in game situations. This distance requires significant arm strength while still demanding accuracy and proper mechanics.

This phase completes the progression of standard throwing distances, challenging players to maintain proper mechanics at distances that require near-maximum effort. Mastering throws at this distance prepares players for all standard game-situation throws and provides the foundation for the long toss phase that follows.

After 60 seconds of normal throws at 120 feet, partners will transition to the semi-long toss phase, where they'll throw at their maximum comfortable distance with a higher arc trajectory.
