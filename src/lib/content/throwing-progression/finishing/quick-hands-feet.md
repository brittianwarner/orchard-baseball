# Quick Hands Quick Feet

The final phase of the throwing progression simulates game-like scenarios where fielders must quickly transfer and throw after fielding a ball. This drill develops the rapid hand and foot movements needed in actual game situations.

## Setup

**Duration**: 60 seconds
**Distance**: 60 feet apart
**Position**: Standing, facing partner in fielding position

## Execution

1. **Starting Position**:
   - Stand facing your partner at 60 feet distance
   - Begin in a fielding-ready athletic position
   - Glove out front, prepared to field
2. **Fielding and Throwing Motion**:
   - As the ball arrives, field it cleanly with two hands
   - Quickly transfer the ball from glove to throwing hand
   - Simultaneously align your feet toward the target
   - Execute a quick, compact throwing motion
   - Release quickly but maintain proper mechanics
   - Follow through appropriately after release
3. **Reset**:
   - Immediately return to fielding position
   - Prepare to field the return throw
   - Repeat the quick hands and feet sequence

## Coaching Points

### Proper Technique

- **Quick Transfer**: Efficient movement from glove to throwing hand
- **Footwork**: Rapid alignment toward target
- **Balance**: Maintain balance despite quick movements
- **Compact Motion**: Slightly abbreviated but still mechanically sound throw
- **Control**: Accuracy remains priority despite increased speed

### Common Errors to Avoid

- Rushing so much that mechanics break down
- Poor footwork leading to off-target throws
- Dropping the ball during transfer
- "All arm" throws without proper body alignment
- Sacrificing accuracy for speed

### Progression Goals

- Develop game-speed fielding and throwing
- Refine the transfer from fielding to throwing
- Improve efficiency of movement
- Build quickness without sacrificing accuracy
- Condition players for game situations

## Why This Matters

The quick hands quick feet drill simulates the time pressure players face during games. It teaches them to field, transfer, and throw efficiently while maintaining mechanical integrity under pressure. This drill bridges the gap between controlled practice throws and game-speed plays.

This final phase of the throwing progression challenges players to apply all the mechanical elements they've practiced in the earlier stages, but now with time pressure added. The skills developed here directly translate to defensive efficiency in games.

After completing the throwing progression, players should have progressed from isolated mechanics through full-speed game simulation, building both proper technique and arm strength in a safe, progressive manner.
