# Coming Back In

After reaching maximum comfortable throwing distance, players now gradually reduce distance while maintaining proper throwing mechanics. This phase is crucial for proper arm recovery and preparation for game-speed throws.

## Setup

**Duration**: Variable (typically 2-3 minutes)
**Distance**: Gradually decreasing from maximum distance to 60 feet
**Position**: Standing, with partners gradually walking closer

## Execution

1. **Starting Position**:
   - Begin at your maximum comfortable throwing distance
   - After 2-3 throws, both partners take a few steps inward
   - Continue this pattern until reaching 60 feet
2. **Throwing Motion**:
   - Maintain the high arc trajectory as distance decreases
   - Use the same full-body mechanics as previous throws
   - Continue with controlled effort (not maximum)
   - Gradually transition from high arc to more direct throws
   - Keep proper follow-through on all throws
3. **Distance Reduction**:
   - Take 3-5 steps inward after every couple of throws
   - Communication with partner is important for coordinated movement
   - Final position should be at standard baseball distance (60 feet)

## Coaching Points

### Proper Technique

- **Controlled Arc**: Maintain high arc initially, gradually flattening
- **Consistent Mechanics**: Same throwing motion throughout
- **Smooth Transition**: Fluid adjustment as distance decreases
- **Arm Care**: Maintain loose, relaxed throwing motion
- **Communication**: Coordinate distance changes with partner

### Common Errors to Avoid

- Sudden reduction in distance rather than gradual
- Dramatic changes in throwing mechanics with distance change
- Flat throws immediately after long toss
- Increasing effort level as distance decreases
- Rushing through the coming-in phase

### Progression Goals

- Develop distance feel and trajectory control
- Maintain arm health through proper transitions
- Replicate game-like throwing mechanics
- Prepare arm for game-speed throws
- Complete arm conditioning cycle

## Why This Matters

The coming-in phase is vital for arm health and recovery. By gradually reducing distance rather than immediately jumping to short throws, players allow their arm to naturally transition back to game-like throwing distances and trajectories.

This phase helps condition the arm safely while reinforcing the connection between distance and trajectory. The gradual adjustment from high-arc throws to more direct throws teaches players to adjust their throwing mechanics based on distance requirements.

After reaching 60 feet, players are prepared for the final phase of the progression - quick hands quick feet - which introduces game-speed fielding and throwing mechanics.
