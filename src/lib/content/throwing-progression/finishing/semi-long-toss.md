# Easy Semi-Long Toss

After progressing through increasing distances with normal throws, players now transition to semi-long toss throws with higher arc trajectories. This phase helps develop arm strength while maintaining proper mechanics.

## Setup

**Duration**: Variable (typically 2-3 minutes)
**Distance**: Maximum comfortable distance (beyond 120 feet)
**Position**: Standing, facing partner at extended distance

## Execution

1. **Starting Position**:
   - Stand facing your partner at your maximum comfortable throwing distance
   - Feet in athletic position, squared to partner
   - Hold the baseball with a four-seam grip
2. **Throwing Motion**:
   - Use full body mechanics similar to previous throws
   - Modify release angle to create a higher arc trajectory
   - Focus on keeping the throw "easy" - not maximum effort
   - Keep the ball high in the air with good backspin
   - Follow through completely with arm and body
3. **Reset**:
   - Field your partner's return throw
   - Reset to starting position
   - Repeat the semi-long toss throw

## Coaching Points

### Proper Technique

- **Trajectory**: Higher arc than previous throws
- **Backspin**: Generate consistent backspin for proper carry
- **Effort Level**: Controlled effort (approximately 70-80%)
- **Arm Angle**: Slightly higher release point
- **Full Body**: Continue using complete throwing mechanics
- **Follow Through**: Complete follow-through with arm and body

### Common Errors to Avoid

- Throwing at maximum effort
- Flat trajectory (line drives) instead of arc
- Overthrowing and sacrificing mechanics
- Dropping elbow below shoulder level
- Excessive upper body lean back

### Progression Goals

- Build arm strength through extended distance
- Maintain proper mechanics at longer distances
- Develop feel for appropriate throw trajectory
- Create throwing stamina while staying controlled

## Why This Matters

The semi-long toss phase develops arm strength while teaching players to adjust throw trajectory for different distances. The higher arc allows for greater distances without maximum effort, protecting the arm while building strength.

This phase bridges between the distance-building throws and the coming-in phase of the progression. By keeping the throws "easy" with a higher arc, players learn to throw for distance efficiently without overthrowing or risking injury.

After completing the semi-long toss phase, partners will begin to gradually decrease distance in the coming-in portion of the progression.
