# Short Hops Underhanded

This drill follows the elbow on glove flip and focuses on developing proper fielding technique for short hops while still in the stable two-knee position.

## Setup

**Duration**: 60 seconds
**Distance**: 5-10 feet apart
**Position**: Both partners on two knees, facing each other

## Execution

1. **Starting Position**:
   - Kneel on both knees, facing your partner about 5-10 feet away
   - Hold the baseball with an underhand grip
   - Partner should be in a receiving position with glove ready
2. **Throwing Motion**:
   - Using an underhand motion, toss the ball toward your partner
   - Aim to bounce the ball once about 1-2 feet in front of your partner
   - Create a true "short hop" that challenges receiving technique
   - Vary the pace slightly to create different hop reactions
3. **Receiving**:
   - Partner should field the short hop with proper technique
   - Glove should work down-to-up through the ball
   - Eyes should track the ball all the way to the glove
   - Quick transfer to throwing hand after fielding

## Coaching Points

### Proper Technique for Thrower

- **Consistent Bounces**: Create consistent short hops that bounce once
- **Appropriate Speed**: Firm enough to simulate game action, but controlled
- **Target Location**: Aim directly at partner's midline
- **Variation**: Slightly vary speeds and locations within reason

### Proper Technique for Receiver

- **Athletic Ready Position**: Hands out front, weight forward
- **Hand Position**: Glove fingers pointed down to the ground
- **Work Through the Ball**: Hands work up through the ball, not stabbing
- **Two Hands**: Use both hands whenever possible
- **Eye Tracking**: Keep eyes on the ball through the catch

### Common Errors to Avoid

- Bouncing the ball too far in front of partner (long hop)
- Throwing too hard making reception difficult
- Receiver stabbing down at the ball instead of working through it
- Receiver looking away before securing the ball
- Poor ready position making quick adjustments difficult

### Progression Goals

- Develop proper short hop fielding technique
- Build hand-eye coordination for difficult bounces
- Establish comfortable rhythm between partners
- Prepare hands for fielding ground balls

## Why This Matters

Short hop fielding is one of the most challenging skills in baseball defense. By practicing this skill early in the throwing progression while still in a stable position, players develop proper receiving technique without the added complexity of footwork.

This drill complements the wrist action developed in the elbow on glove flip by focusing on the receiving aspect of the throwing exchange. Players develop the hand-eye coordination necessary for fielding difficult hops while maintaining a stable body position.

After completing 60 seconds of short hop underhand tosses, partners will move on to practicing the two-knee throw and fall drill.
