# Short Hops Soft Throw

Following the two-knee throw and fall drill, this exercise advances short hop fielding practice by incorporating soft overhand throws at a slightly increased distance, continuing to develop fielding skills in the two-knee position.

## Setup

**Duration**: 60 seconds
**Distance**: 15-20 feet apart
**Position**: Both partners on two knees, facing each other

## Execution

1. **Starting Position**:
   - Kneel on both knees, facing your partner 15-20 feet away
   - Hold the baseball with a four-seam grip
   - Partner should be in a ready fielding position on two knees
2. **Throwing Motion**:
   - Using a soft, controlled overhand throwing motion
   - Throw the ball to bounce once about 2-3 feet in front of your partner
   - Create a short hop that requires proper fielding technique
   - Use about 50% of your normal throwing effort - keep it controlled
   - Focus on consistent bounces that simulate game situations
3. **Receiving**:
   - Partner should field the short hop with proper technique
   - Work through the ball with both hands
   - Secure the ball in glove then make a clean transfer
   - Reset quickly to return the throw using the same technique

## Coaching Points

### Proper Technique for Thrower

- **Controlled Motion**: Soft, controlled overhand throws
- **Bounce Point**: Consistent bounce point in front of partner
- **Arm Mechanics**: Use proper arm action despite reduced velocity
- **Target Area**: Aim for partner's midline to limit lateral movement
- **Consistency**: Create similar hops for repeated practice

### Proper Technique for Receiver

- **Ready Position**: Hands out front, weight slightly forward
- **Field Through the Ball**: Work hands up through the hop
- **Soft Hands**: Absorb the energy of the ball rather than fighting it
- **Two-Hand Technique**: Use both hands to secure the ball
- **Quick Exchange**: Practice clean transfer to throwing hand

### Common Errors to Avoid

- Throwing too hard, making fielding unnecessarily difficult
- Erratic bounces that don't allow for skill development
- Fielder backing up instead of working through the ball
- Fielder becoming passive rather than aggressive to the ball
- Poor hand positioning when receiving the ball

### Progression Goals

- Advance short hop fielding ability from the stable two-knee position
- Develop proper receiving technique for game-like bounces
- Build hand-eye coordination with increased distance
- Prepare for the next progression of more challenging fielding scenarios
- Create muscle memory for proper glove positioning on different hops

## Why This Matters

Short hop fielding skills are critical for infield defense. This drill builds upon the earlier underhand short hop drill by increasing the distance and introducing overhand throws that more closely simulate game situations.

By maintaining the two-knee position, players can focus exclusively on hand technique without footwork variables. The slightly increased distance requires more reading of the ball trajectory and hop, developing essential tracking skills for defensive players.

After completing 60 seconds of this drill, partners will progress to the one-knee position for the next phase of the throwing progression, beginning to incorporate more elements of the complete fielding and throwing motion.
