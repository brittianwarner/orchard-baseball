# Elbow on Glove Flip

This is the first active throwing drill in the progression. It isolates wrist action while eliminating other variables, helping establish proper ball release and wrist mechanics.

## Setup

**Duration**: 60 seconds
**Distance**: 5 feet apart
**Position**: Both partners on two knees, facing each other

## Execution

1. **Starting Position**:

   - Kneel on both knees, facing your partner about 5 feet away
   - Place your throwing elbow in your glove at waist level
   - Hold the baseball with a four-seam grip in your throwing hand

2. **Throwing Motion**:

   - Keep elbow stationary in your glove throughout the drill
   - Use only your wrist to flip the baseball to your partner
   - Focus on a clean release and a smooth wrist snap
   - Maintain a consistent four-seam grip orientation

3. **Receiving**:
   - Catch the ball with two hands
   - Quickly reset to the starting position
   - Return the throw using the same mechanics

## Coaching Points

### Proper Technique

- **Limited Movement**: Only the wrist should be active; elbow stays stationary
- **Grip**: Maintain a proper four-seam grip throughout
- **Wrist Action**: Focus on a consistent snap of the wrist
- **Hand Position**: Fingers should stay on top of the ball
- **Thumb Position**: Thumb underneath the ball for proper backspin

### Common Errors to Avoid

- Using arm strength instead of wrist action
- Removing elbow from glove during the throw
- Incorrect grip or inconsistent ball orientation
- Attempting to throw too hard

### Progression Goals

- Develop feel for proper ball release
- Establish consistent backspin
- Build wrist strength and flexibility
- Create muscle memory for proper finish position

## Why This Matters

The wrist flip isolates the final component of the throwing motion. By eliminating other variables like arm action and body rotation, players can focus exclusively on proper release mechanics and wrist action. This foundational skill will carry through each subsequent step of the throwing progression.

After completing 60 seconds of this drill, partners should move back to 15-20 feet apart for the next phase while remaining on two knees.
