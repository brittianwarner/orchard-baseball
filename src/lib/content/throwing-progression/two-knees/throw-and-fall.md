# Two-Knee Throw and Fall

The second phase of the throwing progression introduces more elements of the throwing motion while still maintaining stability from the two-knee position.

## Setup

**Duration**: 60 seconds
**Distance**: 15-20 feet apart
**Position**: Both partners on two knees, facing each other

## Execution

1. **Starting Position**:

   - Kneel on both knees, facing your partner 15-20 feet away
   - Hold the baseball with a four-seam grip
   - Glove arm extended toward target, throwing arm in ready position

2. **Throwing Motion**:

   - Break hands naturally, bringing ball back into throwing position
   - Use a full arm circle motion while maintaining two-knee position
   - Throw the ball with proper mechanics to your partner
   - After release, allow your upper body to fall forward naturally
   - Chest should move toward the target, emphasizing follow-through

3. **Reset**:
   - Return to upright position on both knees
   - Prepare to receive the return throw

## Coaching Points

### Proper Technique

- **Arm Action**: Full arm motion with proper shoulder rotation
- **Torso Rotation**: Upper body should rotate with the throw
- **Follow Through**: Emphasis on falling forward after release
- **Weight Transfer**: Even though on knees, weight should shift forward
- **Hand Position**: Fingers stay on top of the ball at release

### Common Errors to Avoid

- Staying too rigid without follow-through
- Not allowing natural fall forward after release
- Throwing with arm only (no torso rotation)
- Improper grip or release point
- Rising up off knees during the throw

### Progression Goals

- Develop proper arm action while in stable position
- Emphasize the importance of follow-through
- Build arm strength through consistent repetition
- Establish connection between upper body and throw

## Why This Matters

The two-knee throw and fall introduces proper arm action and follow-through while still eliminating lower body variables. This controlled environment allows players to focus on upper body mechanics and proper finish position. The forward fall after release teaches the importance of momentum toward the target.

This drill builds upon the wrist action from the previous step while adding arm path and torso rotation elements. The stable knee position reduces variables while players develop feel for proper upper body mechanics.

After completing 60 seconds of this drill, partners will progress to the one-knee position for the next phase of the throwing progression.
