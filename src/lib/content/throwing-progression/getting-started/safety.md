# Safety Considerations for Throwing Progression

Before beginning any throwing program, it's vital to prioritize safety to prevent injury and maximize development. Follow these guidelines to ensure a safe and effective throwing progression.

## Pre-Throwing Safety Checklist

### Physical Preparation

- **Proper Warmup**: Complete a comprehensive dynamic warmup before throwing
- **Arm Care**: Perform appropriate band or tubing exercises if prescribed
- **Hydration**: Be well-hydrated before beginning the throwing progression
- **Rest**: Ensure adequate rest between throwing sessions (typically 24-48 hours)

### Health Assessment

- **Pain-Free**: Never throw through pain - especially in the shoulder, elbow, or wrist
- **Previous Injuries**: Notify coaches about any previous arm injuries
- **Fatigue**: Do not continue throwing when experiencing fatigue
- **Recovery**: Follow recommended recovery protocols between sessions

### Equipment and Environment

- **Proper Footwear**: Wear appropriate athletic shoes with good traction
- **Weather Conditions**: Adjust or postpone during extreme weather conditions
- **Field Surface**: Ensure safe throwing surface without hazards
- **Proper Equipment**: Use appropriately sized baseballs for age/skill level

## Supervision Guidelines

- Young players should always have coach/adult supervision
- Follow coach's instructions on throwing limits and intensity
- Report any discomfort immediately to the coach
- Never rush through the progression steps

## When to Stop Throwing

Immediately stop throwing and notify a coach if you experience:

- Pain in the throwing arm (not normal muscle fatigue)
- Unusual sensations like tingling or numbness
- Inability to control where the ball is going
- Significant decrease in throwing velocity

## Progressive Approach

- The throwing progression is designed to gradually build arm strength
- Respect the time allocations for each step (60 seconds per drill)
- Don't skip steps or rush through the progression
- Focus on proper mechanics over distance or velocity

Remember that proper throwing mechanics developed through a structured progression are essential for long-term arm health and baseball performance.
