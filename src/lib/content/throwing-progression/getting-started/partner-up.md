# Partnering for Throwing Progression

The throwing progression is designed to be done with a partner. A good throwing partner helps develop accuracy, provides feedback, and makes the progression both effective and enjoyable.

## Selecting a Partner

### Ideal Partner Characteristics

- **Similar Size/Age**: Partners of similar physical development work best
- **Similar Skill Level**: Matching throwing abilities enhances the experience
- **Reliability**: Choose someone who will be attentive and consistent
- **Communication**: Partner should provide constructive feedback

### Partner Positioning

- Always stand directly across from each other
- Maintain proper spacing for each phase (starting at 5 feet, ending at 120+ feet)
- Align in a straight line to promote proper throwing mechanics
- Adjust position to accommodate partner's throws as needed

## Partner Communication

### Before Throwing

- Make eye contact before each throw
- Ensure partner is ready to receive the ball
- Communicate any adjustments needed (distance, height, etc.)
- Agree on the progression pace

### During Throwing

- Provide positive feedback on good throws
- Offer constructive tips when appropriate
- Signal if throws are consistently high, low, or off-target
- Alert partner if you're uncomfortable with velocity or distance

## Safety with Partners

- Never rush your partner through the progression
- Take turns retrieving overthrown balls
- Watch for signs of arm fatigue in your partner
- Be honest about your own comfort and fatigue levels

## Coaching Points for Partners

- Encourage proper mechanics over velocity
- Watch for follow-through and proper finish
- Keep count of the time for each drill (60 seconds per drill)
- Celebrate improvements in technique

## Partner Throwing Etiquette

- Return throws with similar effort level
- Wait for partner to be ready before throwing
- Support your partner's development
- Be patient with missed catches or errant throws
- Thank your partner after completing the progression

Effective partnering enhances the throwing progression experience and helps build teamwork skills necessary for game situations.
