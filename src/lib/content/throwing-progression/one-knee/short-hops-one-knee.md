# Short Hops on One Knee

This drill continues the progression of short hop fielding by advancing to the one-knee position, adding a new level of challenge while still maintaining partial stability.

## Setup

**Duration**: 60 seconds
**Distance**: 15-20 feet apart
**Position**: Both partners on one knee (throwing-hand knee down), facing each other

## Execution

1. **Starting Position**:
   - Kneel with your throwing-hand knee down, glove-side knee up at 90 degrees
   - Face your partner 15-20 feet away (also in one-knee position)
   - Hold the baseball with a four-seam grip
   - Position your body in a ready fielding posture
2. **Throwing Motion**:
   - Using a controlled overhand throwing motion
   - Throw the ball to bounce once about 2-3 feet in front of your partner
   - Create a short hop that requires proper fielding technique
   - Use proper upper body mechanics despite the focus on creating a bounce
   - Vary the pace slightly while maintaining control
3. **Receiving**:
   - Field the short hop while maintaining the one-knee position
   - Work through the ball with proper glove technique
   - Use the raised knee (glove-side) to help block and control the ball if needed
   - Make a clean transfer to throwing hand
   - Return the throw using the same short hop technique

## Coaching Points

### Proper Technique for Thrower

- **Controlled Throws**: Firm but controlled tosses that create true short hops
- **Consistent Target**: Aim for partner's midline to promote proper fielding position
- **Upper Body Mechanics**: Use proper throwing mechanics despite the intentional bounce
- **Bounce Location**: Create bounces that force partner to field the ball out front
- **Rhythm**: Establish a comfortable rhythm with consistent delivery

### Proper Technique for Receiver

- **Athletic One-Knee Position**: Weight slightly forward, hands out front
- **Glove Position**: Fingers down, working up through the ball
- **Use of Raised Knee**: Position raised knee to help control/block errant hops
- **Two Hands**: Field with both hands whenever possible
- **Body Alignment**: Square shoulders to the incoming ball
- **Eyes on Ball**: Track the ball all the way into the glove

### Common Errors to Avoid

- Leaning back when receiving instead of staying forward
- Rising up off the knee when fielding difficult hops
- Stabbing at the ball instead of working through it
- Poor glove positioning (fingers up instead of down)
- Creating inconsistent or unfielable bounces as the thrower
- Not squaring shoulders to the ball

### Progression Goals

- Develop advanced short hop fielding technique
- Build comfort fielding from the one-knee position
- Improve hand-eye coordination with challenging hops
- Create muscle memory for proper fielding mechanics
- Prepare for advanced fielding scenarios in games

## Why This Matters

The one-knee short hop drill builds upon previous short hop exercises by introducing a new body position that more closely resembles game situations. The one-knee position requires better reading skills and hand-eye coordination while still providing some stability.

This drill is particularly valuable for infielders who often field ground balls from a knee-down position on balls hit to their side. By practicing short hops from this position, players develop the ability to field difficult hops with proper technique regardless of body position.

After completing 60 seconds of this drill, partners will progress to standing throws for the next phase of the throwing progression, where full-body mechanics will be incorporated.
