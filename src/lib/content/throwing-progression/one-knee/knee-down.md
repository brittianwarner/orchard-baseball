# Exaggerated Full Throw

This drill continues to build on proper upper body mechanics while introducing more elements of the throwing motion through the one-knee position.

## Setup

**Duration**: 60 seconds
**Distance**: 15-20 feet apart
**Position**: Throwing-hand knee down (right knee for right-handed throwers)

## Execution

1. **Starting Position**:
   - Kneel with your throwing-hand knee down on the ground
   - Position your glove-side knee up at 90 degrees
   - Square your shoulders to your target
   - Hold the baseball with a four-seam grip
2. **Throwing Motion**:
   - Start with a proper grip and hand separation
   - Execute an exaggerated throwing motion with full arm circle
   - Rotate your torso during the throwing motion
   - Follow through completely after release
   - Finish with your chest moving forward toward your down knee
3. **Reset**:
   - Return to starting position without switching knees
   - Prepare to receive the return throw

## Coaching Points

### Proper Technique

- **Knee Position**: Throwing-side knee down, glove-side knee up
- **Torso Rotation**: Rotate back slightly in preparation, then forward with the throw
- **Exaggerated Motion**: Emphasize the complete throwing motion more than in previous drills
- **Follow Through**: Chest should finish toward the down knee
- **Arm Action**: Complete arm circle with proper mechanics

### Common Errors to Avoid

- Keeping torso rigid or not rotating properly
- Insufficient follow-through after release
- Rising up off the knee during the throw
- Improper grip or arm angle
- Minimal chest movement toward the down knee

### Progression Goals

- Further develop proper arm action and torso rotation
- Increase emphasis on follow-through mechanics
- Begin to incorporate more body elements into the throw
- Establish connection between upper body and throw

## Why This Matters

The one-knee position is the bridge between stationary throwing and full-body mechanics. By placing the throwing-side knee down, players learn proper upper body rotation while still maintaining a stable base. The exaggerated motion helps develop muscle memory for proper throwing mechanics.

This drill reinforces the importance of chest movement toward the target after release, which is essential for proper follow-through and arm health. The one-knee position also begins to incorporate the lower body into the throwing motion in a controlled manner.

After completing 60 seconds of this drill, partners will practice fielding short hops from the one-knee position before progressing to standing throws for the next phase of the throwing progression.
