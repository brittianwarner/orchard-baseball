# Running Progressions

This section focuses on dynamic lower body exercises and running progressions that prepare players for the explosive movements required in baseball.

## Foul Line Dynamic Stretching

These exercises are performed while moving from the foul line to the pitcher's mound, focusing on dynamic lower body mobility.

### Knee Hugs

- While walking forward, lift one knee to chest height
- Pull the knee in with both hands, holding briefly
- Release and step forward, then repeat with the opposite leg
- Continues movement pattern to the pitcher's mound
- Helps open the hips and activates the core

### Walking Quad Reach to the Sky

- While walking, reach back and grab one ankle behind the body
- Simultaneously reach the opposite hand toward the sky
- Hold briefly, then release and step forward
- Repeat with the opposite limbs
- Stretches the quadriceps while improving balance and coordination

### Walking Kick Forward, RDL Back

- Kick one leg forward while keeping it straight
- Step down, then perform a controlled single-leg Romanian deadlift (RDL)
- Balance on one leg while hinging at the hips and extending the other leg behind
- Alternate legs while progressing forward
- Improves hamstring flexibility and balance

### Close Gate Forward and Open Gate Back

- Lift one knee high, then rotate it inward across the body (closing the gate)
- Step forward, then lift the next knee and rotate outward (opening the gate)
- Focus on controlled hip rotation throughout the movement
- Helps mobilize the hip joint in multiple planes of motion

### Lunges (Extended Step and Keep Balance)

- Take a long step forward into a deep lunge position
- Ensure the front knee is aligned over the ankle
- Hold briefly, focusing on balance and stability
- Push off the front foot to step forward into the next lunge
- Targets the quadriceps, glutes, and core muscles

### Side Lunges

- Step laterally into a deep lunge, keeping the opposite leg straight
- Push the hips back and down while keeping the chest up
- Return to the starting position before stepping to the opposite side
- Engages the adductors and improves lateral mobility

### 2 Slide Step Lunge

- Take two lateral shuffle steps to the side
- Drop into a lunge position
- Return to standing and repeat in the opposite direction
- Combines lateral movement with strength and stability work

## Progressive Speed Exercises

These drills gradually increase in intensity to safely prepare players for game-speed movements.

### Side Shuffle

- Assume a partial squat position with feet shoulder-width apart
- Move laterally by pushing off the inside foot
- Keep hips low and chest up throughout the movement
- Maintain athletic position without crossing feet
- Essential for infielder lateral movement

### High Knee Karaoke

- Move laterally while performing a crossover step pattern
- Emphasize knee height and fluid hip rotation
- Cross the trailing leg both in front of and behind the lead leg
- Focus on rhythm and coordination
- Improves multi-directional mobility

### High Knees

- Run forward while driving knees up to waist level
- Stay on the balls of the feet with a slight forward lean
- Pump arms in coordination with leg movement
- Perform for 10-15 yards
- Activates hip flexors and improves running form

### Butt Kicks

- Run forward while kicking heels up toward glutes
- Maintain upright posture with a slight forward lean
- Focus on quick foot contacts with the ground
- Emphasizes hamstring engagement and quick turnover

### Explosive Skip (Forward and Backward)

- Perform exaggerated skips focusing on height and distance
- Drive the knee up while extending the opposite arm
- Land softly and immediately transition to the next skip
- Repeat going backwards with controlled movement
- Develops explosive power in the lower body

## Baseball-Specific Running

These drills simulate game situations to prepare players for actual baseball movements.

### Running to 2nd

- Sprint at game speed from home plate to second base
- Focus on proper acceleration and base-running form
- Run through the base as in a game situation
- Simulates hitting a double or stealing second

### Progressive Speed Runs

- **50% Run**: Jog at half-speed to build proper mechanics
- **75% Run**: Increase to three-quarter speed effort
- **100% Run**: Full-effort sprint focusing on acceleration and form

### Running Progressions (Coach as Pitcher)

- **Take a Lead with Jog Back**: Players take a lead off base while coach simulates a pitch
- Focus on proper lead-off technique and weight distribution
- Run to second base, then jog back after passing the base

### Game Situation Runs

- **50% Hit and Run**: At half speed, simulate taking off while looking for the ball
- **75% Delayed Steal (3 Slide Shuffle)**: Practice secondary lead with three shuffle steps before stealing
- **75% Normal 2 Shuffle**: Secondary lead with two shuffles and break toward next base
- **75% 3rd Base 3 Step**: Secondary lead from third base, preparing for potential steal home
- **75% 3rd Base Tag**: Practice tagging up from third on a fly ball
- **100% Normal Steal (with Peak)**: Execute full-speed steal while incorporating a quick glance toward the catcher

These running progressions should be performed in sequence, allowing the body to gradually prepare for full-speed baseball movements. Proper form is essential throughout all exercises.
