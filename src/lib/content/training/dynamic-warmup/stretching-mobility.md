# Stretching and Mobility

This section covers the initial phases of the dynamic warmup, focusing on upper body preparation, core activation, and band work to prepare the player's body for baseball activities.

## Initial Movement

### Jog Along the Warning Track (2 poles)

- Players jog along the warning track from one outfield foul pole to the other and back
- Maintain a steady pace to gradually increase heart rate
- Focus on controlled breathing and loosening up muscles
- This serves as a general warmup before more specific movements

### Line up in 4 columns

- Players organize into four even columns on the field
- This formation ensures efficient execution of the remaining warmup drills
- Provides proper spacing for movement exercises
- Allows coaches to observe form and technique

## Upper Body Preparation

### Forearm Stretches (Each side by hands)

- Extend one arm straight in front at shoulder height
- Use the opposite hand to gently pull back on the fingers (including thumb)
- Hold for 10-15 seconds to stretch the forearm and wrist flexors
- Repeat on both sides
- Particularly important for throwing and batting

### Arm Circles (Small to big, both directions)

- Begin with arms extended out to sides at shoulder height
- Start with small circles (about 6 inches in diameter)
- Gradually increase to larger circles (full range of motion)
- Perform both forward and backward rotations (10-15 each direction)
- Engages the shoulder rotator cuff muscles and improves mobility

### Arms Across Chest

- Pull one arm across the chest with the opposite hand
- Hold for 10-15 seconds, feeling the stretch in the posterior shoulder
- Release and repeat on the opposite side
- Helps prepare the shoulder for throwing motions

### Arms Behind Head

- Place one arm behind the head, elbow pointed upward
- Use the opposite hand to gently pull the elbow down and back
- Hold for 10-15 seconds to stretch the triceps and shoulder
- Switch sides and repeat
- Improves overhead mobility required for throwing

## Core Activation

### Torso Rotations

- Stand with feet shoulder-width apart
- Extend arms out to sides at shoulder height
- Twist the torso side to side in a controlled motion
- Keep hips facing forward while rotating the upper body
- Perform 10-15 rotations to each side
- Activates the core and prepares the body for rotational movements in hitting and throwing

## Band Work

Using light resistance bands, perform the following exercises to activate the rotator cuff and stabilizing muscles:

### Overhead Butterfly, Front to Back (20 reps)

- Hold a resistance band above head with both hands
- Perform butterfly-like movements by bringing arms from front to back
- Maintain tension in the band throughout the movement
- Enhances shoulder mobility and stability for throwing

### Xs (20 reps)

- Hold a resistance band with both hands in front of the body
- Position hands with pinkies pointing outward
- Draw an "X" pattern by moving arms outward
- Focus on controlled movements and proper scapular engagement
- Activates key stabilizer muscles in the shoulder complex

### Butterfly at Waist (20 palm up, 20 palm down)

- Hold a resistance band at waist level with both hands
- Perform butterfly motions with pinkies pointing outward
- Complete 20 repetitions with palms facing up
- Complete 20 repetitions with palms facing down
- Targets different aspects of the rotator cuff

### Throwing Arm Statue of Liberty (20 reps)

- Hold one end of the resistance band overhead with throwing arm
- Hold the other end at waist level with opposite hand
- Perform slow, controlled raising movements
- Simulates the throwing motion while providing resistance
- Particularly effective for pitchers and infielders

These exercises should be performed with proper form and controlled movements. If any exercise causes pain (not just muscle fatigue), players should notify a coach immediately.
