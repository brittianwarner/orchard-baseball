# Progressive Speed Runs

Progressive Speed Runs are a series of running drills that systematically increase intensity from 50% to 100% effort. This graduated approach safely prepares the neuromuscular system for maximum exertion while developing proper running mechanics.

## Execution

### 50% Run

1. Start in an athletic stance
2. Accelerate to half of your maximum speed (50% effort)
3. Focus on proper running mechanics and form
4. Maintain control and technique throughout
5. Run for approximately 15-20 yards
6. Gradually decelerate at the end

### 75% Run

1. After completing the 50% run and brief recovery
2. Accelerate to three-quarters of maximum speed (75% effort)
3. Increase arm drive and knee lift compared to the 50% run
4. Maintain proper running mechanics
5. Run for approximately 15-20 yards
6. Gradually decelerate at the end

### 100% Run

1. After completing the 75% run and brief recovery
2. Accelerate to maximum speed (100% effort)
3. Focus on powerful arm drive and full running mechanics
4. Maintain proper form at top speed
5. Run for approximately 15-20 yards
6. Gradually decelerate at the end

## Purpose

Progressive Speed Runs provide multiple benefits for baseball players:

- Safely prepare the body for maximum exertion
- Develop proper running mechanics at increasing intensities
- Improve neuromuscular coordination at different speeds
- Reduce injury risk by gradually increasing intensity
- Enhance sprint technique through progressive loading
- Develop speed awareness and self-regulation
- Bridge the gap between warmup and game-speed activities

## Muscle Groups Targeted

- Quadriceps
- Hamstrings
- Gluteal complex
- Hip flexors
- Gastrocnemius and soleus
- Core stabilizers
- Shoulder and arm muscles (for sprint mechanics)
- Fast-twitch muscle fibers (increasingly engaged with intensity)

## Coaching Points

- Emphasize the distinct effort levels (50%, 75%, 100%)
- Focus on mechanical consistency across all speeds
- Maintain proper running posture at each intensity level
- Drive arms more powerfully as speed increases
- Increase stride frequency (not just length) at higher speeds
- Ensure proper foot contacts at all speeds
- Allow adequate recovery between each progressive run
- Visualize game situations during the 100% sprint

## Common Mistakes

- Insufficient contrast between effort levels
- Poor mechanical changes as speed increases
- Starting too fast on the 50% run
- Inadequate arm drive at higher speeds
- Leaning too far forward or backward at higher speeds
- Not reaching true 100% effort on the final run
- Insufficient recovery between runs
- Overstriding at higher speeds

## Variations

- **Distance Progression**: Increase distance with each speed level
- **Baseline Running**: Perform runs from home to first base
- **Multi-Directional**: Include backward and lateral progressive runs
- **Visual Stimulus**: React to coach's signal to start each run
- **Recovery Focus**: Emphasize active recovery between runs

Progressive Speed Runs are crucial for baseball players as they develop proper running mechanics while systematically preparing the body for the explosive sprints required during games. This methodical approach ensures players can safely achieve maximum speed when needed while minimizing injury risk.
