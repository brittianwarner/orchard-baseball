# Game Situation Running

Game Situation Running drills simulate specific base running scenarios players will encounter during games. These drills develop both the physical and mental components of baseball-specific movement while reinforcing proper technique in context.

## Execution

### Running Progressions (Coach as Pitcher) - Take a Lead with Jog Back

1. Start at first base in proper base running position
2. Take a primary lead of 2-3 steps off the base
3. Coach simulates a pitch from the mound
4. Player takes a secondary lead (crossover step) as the pitch is delivered
5. On coach's signal, runner breaks toward second base
6. Run past second base at game speed
7. Gradually decelerate and jog back to the starting position

### 50% Hit and Run - Take Off and Look for the Ball

1. Start at first base with a primary lead
2. Coach simulates a pitch from the mound
3. Player starts running at 50% speed on the "pitch"
4. While running, turn head to look for the "ball" (as if hit by a batter)
5. Adjust running path based on the imaginary hit location
6. Practice proper visual mechanics while running
7. Return to starting position after completing the drill

### 75% Delayed Steal with 3 Slide Shuffle

1. Start at first base with a primary lead
2. Coach simulates a pitch and "catch" by the catcher
3. Take a secondary lead with three shuffle steps
4. Initiate a delayed steal at 75% speed toward second base
5. Focus on reading the "catcher" and timing the steal
6. Run at 75% effort with proper acceleration mechanics
7. Return to starting position after completing the drill

### 75% Normal Secondary Lead with 2 Shuffle

1. Start at first base with a primary lead
2. Coach simulates a pitch from the mound
3. Take a secondary lead with two shuffle steps
4. On coach's signal, break toward second base at 75% speed
5. Focus on the explosive first step from the secondary lead
6. Practice proper acceleration mechanics
7. Return to starting position after completing the drill

### 75% 3rd Base Secondary Lead (3 Step)

1. Start at third base with a primary lead
2. Coach simulates a pitch from the mound
3. Take a three-step secondary lead toward home
4. Read the coach's signal for whether to break for home
5. If signaled, run at 75% speed toward home
6. Focus on explosive acceleration and proper line to home plate
7. Return to starting position after completing the drill

### 75% 3rd Base Tag-Up

1. Start on third base
2. On coach's signal, take a proper position for a tag-up
3. Coach simulates catching a fly ball and signals the catch
4. Player tags the base and breaks for home at 75% speed
5. Focus on proper timing and technique for the tag-up
6. Practice reading the outfielder and making the decision to run
7. Return to starting position after completing the drill

### 100% Normal Steal with Peak

1. Start at first base with a primary lead
2. On coach's signal, break for second base at 100% speed
3. While running, take a quick "peak" toward the catcher
4. Maintain maximum speed while incorporating the head turn
5. Focus on proper stealing technique at game speed
6. Practice decision-making based on the "catcher's throw"
7. Return to starting position after completing the drill

## Purpose

These game situation drills provide multiple benefits:

- Simulate actual game scenarios in a controlled environment
- Develop specific baseball movement patterns and techniques
- Improve decision-making skills while in motion
- Enhance the ability to combine visual scanning with movement
- Build situation-specific muscle memory
- Develop timing and rhythm for various base running situations
- Prepare players for the mental and physical demands of the game

## Coaching Points

- Focus on realism in simulating game situations
- Emphasize proper technique for each specific scenario
- Coach should provide clear signals and consistent timing
- Ensure players understand the purpose behind each drill
- Provide immediate feedback on technique and decision-making
- Increase complexity and speed gradually
- Emphasize the mental aspects of each situation
- Maintain communication between coach and players throughout

## Common Mistakes

- Improper primary or secondary leads
- Poor timing on delayed movements
- Inadequate visual scanning while running
- Imprecise footwork during critical moments
- Breaking too early or too late
- Improper running paths
- Losing speed when performing visual checks
- Not simulating game intensity

These game situation running drills are the culmination of the dynamic warmup, bridging the gap between general conditioning and the specific movement patterns required during baseball games. By practicing these situations regularly, players develop both the physical capabilities and mental awareness needed for successful base running in competitive situations.
