# Arms Behind Head

The Arms Behind Head stretch primarily targets the triceps and posterior shoulder muscles. This exercise is particularly valuable for baseball players as it helps to improve overhead mobility needed for throwing motions.

## Execution

1. Stand tall with feet shoulder-width apart and good posture
2. Raise one arm and bend the elbow, placing the hand behind the head near the opposite shoulder blade
3. Use the opposite hand to gently grasp the raised elbow
4. Apply gentle pressure, pulling the elbow down and slightly back
5. Hold for 10-15 seconds, feeling the stretch in the triceps and shoulder
6. Release and repeat with the opposite arm
7. Perform 2-3 repetitions on each side

## Purpose

This stretch provides several benefits for baseball players:

- Increases flexibility in the triceps brachii
- Improves mobility in the shoulder joint for overhead positions
- Enhances range of motion needed for proper throwing mechanics
- Prepares the shoulder for acceleration and deceleration phases of throwing
- Helps prevent injuries related to limited shoulder mobility
- Reduces tension in the posterior shoulder and mid-back

## Muscle Groups Targeted

- Triceps brachii
- Latissimus dorsi
- Posterior deltoid
- Teres major and minor
- Rhomboids
- Upper trapezius

## Coaching Points

- Maintain good spinal alignment and posture
- Apply gentle, consistent pressure on the elbow
- Focus on relaxed breathing during the stretch
- Pull to the point of mild tension, not pain
- Keep the neck relaxed and in a neutral position
- Ensure equal attention to both arms

## Common Mistakes

- Forcing the elbow too far down or back
- Excessive forward head posture during the stretch
- Shrugging the shoulders
- Inadequate hold time
- Holding the breath
- Bending at the waist

## Variations

- **Seated variation**: Can be performed while seated for added stability
- **Wall-assisted**: Use a wall to help guide proper positioning
- **Dynamic version**: Gently move in and out of the stretched position
- **Towel-assisted**: Use a towel to reach the opposite shoulder blade if flexibility is limited

This stretch is particularly important for pitchers and infielders who frequently use overhead throwing motions. Players with limited shoulder mobility should approach this stretch gradually, focusing on proper form rather than depth of stretch.
