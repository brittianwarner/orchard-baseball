# Torso Rotations

Torso Rotations are a dynamic movement that activates the core muscles while improving rotational mobility in the spine. This exercise is crucial for baseball players, whose sport demands powerful rotational movements for both hitting and throwing.

## Execution

1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart in an athletic stance
2. Extend arms straight out to the sides at shoulder height
3. Engage the core muscles and maintain good posture
4. Rotate the torso to one side as far as comfortably possible
5. Return to center and rotate to the opposite side
6. Keep the hips facing forward throughout the movement
7. Perform 10-15 controlled rotations to each side
8. Maintain a steady, deliberate pace

## Purpose

Torso rotations provide several key benefits for baseball players:

- Activate the core muscles used in rotational movements
- Improve mobility in the thoracic spine
- Prepare the body for the rotational demands of swinging and throwing
- Enhance neuromuscular coordination for rotational power
- Increase blood flow to the core and oblique muscles
- Develop kinesthetic awareness of proper rotational mechanics

## Muscle Groups Targeted

- External and internal obliques
- Rectus abdominis
- Transverse abdominis
- Erector spinae
- Rotator cuff muscles (indirectly)
- Latissimus dorsi

## Coaching Points

- Keep the feet planted firmly on the ground
- Maintain a slight bend in the knees
- Focus on rotating from the mid-back, not just the shoulders
- Keep the arms extended throughout the movement
- Control the motion in both directions
- Breathe rhythmically with the movements
- Gradually increase the range of motion as the muscles warm up

## Common Mistakes

- Rotating only from the shoulders or arms
- Moving the hips instead of keeping them stable
- Performing the rotations too quickly
- Inadequate range of motion
- Rounded shoulders or poor posture
- Holding the breath during rotations

## Variations

- **Hands on shoulders**: Place hands on shoulders to increase focus on torso rotation
- **Clasped hands**: Perform with hands clasped in front for increased resistance
- **Forward lean**: Add a slight forward lean to target different aspects of the core
- **Medicine ball**: Use a lightweight medicine ball for more advanced athletes

Torso rotations are especially important for batters and pitchers, who rely heavily on rotational power and mobility. This exercise serves as a bridge between upper and lower body movements in the dynamic warmup sequence.
