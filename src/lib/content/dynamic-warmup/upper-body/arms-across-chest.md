# Arms Across Chest

The Arms Across Chest stretch is an essential component of the upper body warmup that targets the posterior shoulder and upper back muscles. This stretch helps prepare the shoulder complex for the rotational demands of baseball.

## Execution

1. Stand tall with feet shoulder-width apart and good posture
2. Extend one arm straight out in front of the body at shoulder height
3. Using the opposite hand/arm, pull the extended arm across the chest
4. Apply gentle pressure at the elbow or upper arm
5. Hold the stretch for 10-15 seconds, feeling the stretch in the back of the shoulder
6. Release and repeat with the opposite arm
7. Perform 2-3 repetitions on each side

## Purpose

This stretch provides several benefits for baseball players:

- Improves flexibility in the posterior deltoid and rotator cuff
- Increases mobility in the scapula (shoulder blade)
- Reduces tension in the upper back muscles
- Prepares the shoulder complex for throwing motions
- Improves range of motion for batting
- Helps prevent shoulder impingement issues

## Muscle Groups Targeted

- Posterior deltoid
- Infraspinatus and teres minor (rotator cuff muscles)
- Rhomboids
- Trapezius
- Latissimus dorsi

## Coaching Points

- Keep the spine neutral and maintain good posture
- Apply gentle, sustained pressure (not bouncing)
- Pull to the point of mild tension, not pain
- Keep shoulders relaxed, not elevated toward ears
- Breathe deeply during the stretch
- Ensure equal time is spent on both sides

## Common Mistakes

- Pulling too hard or aggressively
- Holding the breath during the stretch
- Hunching the shoulders
- Stretching to the point of pain
- Inadequate hold time (less than 10 seconds)
- Pulling at the wrist rather than the upper arm

## Variations

- **Standing against a wall**: Perform with the back against a wall to maintain proper posture
- **Seated variation**: Can be performed while seated for players with balance issues
- **Partner stretch**: A partner can apply gentle pressure for a more controlled stretch
- **Dynamic version**: Move in and out of the stretch position in a controlled manner

The Arms Across Chest stretch should be performed with controlled, gentle movements to maximize effectiveness while minimizing risk of overstretching.
