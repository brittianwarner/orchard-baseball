# Forearm Stretches

Forearm stretches are a crucial component of the upper body preparation, particularly important for baseball players who rely heavily on grip strength and wrist mobility for throwing and batting.

## Execution

1. Extend one arm straight out in front at shoulder height
2. Palm facing down, fingers pointing forward
3. Use the opposite hand to gently pull the fingers (including thumb) back toward the body
4. Hold for 10-15 seconds, feeling the stretch along the forearm
5. Release and repeat on the opposite arm
6. Perform a second set with palms facing up

## Purpose

These stretches serve several important functions:

- Increase flexibility in the wrist flexors and extensors
- Prepare the forearms for the gripping demands of baseball
- Improve blood flow to the hand and forearm muscles
- Reduce risk of strain or tendonitis in the forearm
- Enhance performance in throwing and batting
- Particularly important for pitchers

## Muscle Groups Targeted

- Wrist flexors (inner forearm)
- Wrist extensors (outer forearm)
- Finger flexors
- Pronators and supinators of the forearm

## Coaching Points

- Extend the arm fully but don't lock the elbow
- Apply gentle pressure - this should be a stretch, not pain
- Ensure players stretch both arms equally
- Hold each stretch long enough to feel the muscles relax
- Breathe normally throughout the stretch
- Emphasize the importance for pitchers, who should spend extra time on this

## Common Mistakes

- Pulling too hard or bouncing during the stretch
- Not including the thumb in the stretch
- Inadequate hold time (too brief)
- Poor posture during the stretch
- Skipping the palm-up variation

## Variations

- **Kneeling Variation**: For a deeper stretch, players can place their palms on the ground with fingers pointing back toward the body
- **Partner Variation**: A partner can provide gentle, controlled resistance
- **Flexor-Specific**: Add a variation to specifically target the inside (palm side) of the forearm

Proper forearm stretching is essential for baseball players at all levels and should be performed consistently as part of the warmup routine.
