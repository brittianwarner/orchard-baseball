# Explosive Skip (Forward and Backward)

Explosive Skips are a dynamic power development exercise that combines vertical power with forward or backward movement. This exercise helps develop the explosive athletic movements required in baseball while reinforcing coordination between the upper and lower body.

## Execution

### Forward Explosive Skips

1. Begin in an athletic stance with feet hip-width apart
2. Drive one knee up forcefully while simultaneously pushing off the ground with the opposite foot
3. Focus on height and distance with each skip
4. Coordinate arm action with leg drive (opposite arm with opposite leg)
5. Land softly on the ball of the foot and immediately transition to the next skip
6. Continue for approximately 10-15 yards
7. Maintain powerful, rhythmic movement throughout

### Backward Explosive Skips

1. Using the same technique, perform skips while moving backward
2. Focus on controlled, powerful movement
3. Maintain balance and body control
4. Use arm action to assist with power generation
5. Continue for approximately 10-15 yards
6. Emphasize height while ensuring safe backward movement

## Purpose

Explosive Skips provide numerous benefits for baseball players:

- Develop lower body explosive power
- Enhance coordination between upper and lower body
- Improve force production through the ground
- Activate fast-twitch muscle fibers needed for explosive movements
- Reinforce proper triple extension (ankle, knee, hip)
- Develop controlled power in multiple directions
- Improve body awareness and proprioception
- Prepare the neuromuscular system for game-speed movements

## Muscle Groups Targeted

- Quadriceps
- Hamstrings
- Gluteal complex
- Gastrocnemius and soleus
- Hip flexors
- Core stabilizers
- Shoulder and arm muscles
- Ankle stabilizers

## Coaching Points

- Focus on maximum height with each skip
- Drive the knee forcefully upward
- Coordinate arm action with leg drive
- Achieve full extension of the pushing leg
- Land softly on the midfoot/forefoot
- Maintain tall posture throughout
- Control the backward skips with visual awareness
- Emphasize power and control rather than speed
- Maintain consistent rhythm and effort

## Common Mistakes

- Insufficient height or power in the skips
- Poor coordination between arms and legs
- Leaning too far forward or backward
- Landing heavily or flat-footed
- Inconsistent rhythm or effort
- Minimal arm action
- Losing balance during backward skips
- Focusing on speed rather than explosive power

## Variations

- **Height-Focused Skips**: Emphasize maximum vertical height
- **Distance Skips**: Focus on covering more ground with each skip
- **Single-Leg Emphasis**: Perform multiple skips on the same leg
- **Reactive Skips**: Respond to coach's command to change directions
- **Skip to Sprint**: Transition from skips directly into a sprint

Explosive Skips are particularly valuable for baseball players as they develop the power and coordination needed for explosive movements like stealing bases, leaping for catches, and explosive first steps when fielding. The bilateral nature of skipping helps ensure balanced power development across both legs.
