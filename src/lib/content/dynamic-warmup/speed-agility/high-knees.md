# High Knees

High Knees is a dynamic running drill that emphasizes exaggerated knee lift while moving forward. This exercise activates the hip flexors, develops proper running mechanics, and increases neuromuscular coordination for explosive movements.

## Execution

1. Begin in an athletic stance with feet hip-width apart
2. Start running forward with an exaggerated knee lift
3. Drive knees up to at least waist level with each step
4. Stay on the balls of your feet - avoid heel striking
5. Maintain a slight forward lean from the ankles
6. Use active, powerful arm action in sync with leg movement
7. Focus on quick ground contacts and rapid knee drive
8. Perform for approximately 10-15 yards
9. Maintain rhythm and height throughout the exercise

## Purpose

High Knees provides several key benefits for baseball players:

- Develops proper running mechanics and knee drive
- Activates hip flexors and extensors in a coordinated pattern
- Increases stride frequency for improved acceleration
- Enhances neuromuscular coordination
- Prepares the body for explosive running movements
- Improves arm-leg coordination essential for efficient running
- Reinforces the athletic posture needed for quick movements

## Muscle Groups Targeted

- Hip flexors (psoas, iliacus, rectus femoris)
- Quadriceps
- Hamstrings
- Gluteal muscles
- Gastrocnemius and soleus
- Anterior tibialis
- Core stabilizers
- Shoulder and arm muscles (for arm swing)

## Coaching Points

- Drive the knees up forcefully to waist height
- Maintain a tall posture with slight forward lean
- Land on the balls of the feet, not the heels
- Keep arms bent at approximately 90 degrees
- Coordinate arm and leg action (opposite arm/leg)
- Focus on quick, rhythmic movement
- Maintain consistent knee height throughout
- Keep head level and eyes forward
- Breathe rhythmically with the movement

## Common Mistakes

- Insufficient knee height
- Leaning too far forward at the waist
- Landing flat-footed or on the heels
- Minimal or uncoordinated arm action
- Inconsistent rhythm or pace
- Excessive vertical bounce
- Forward progression that's too slow
- Looking down at the ground

## Variations

- **Stationary High Knees**: Perform in place to focus on knee height
- **High Knees with Hold**: Brief pause at the top of each knee lift
- **Progressive High Knees**: Gradually increase speed while maintaining form
- **Continuous High Knees**: Extend the distance to build endurance
- **Skipping High Knees**: Add a skipping motion for additional power development

High Knees is an essential drill for baseball players as it develops the quick, powerful knee drive needed for explosive first-step quickness, acceleration when base running, and the rapid footwork required for effective fielding. This exercise helps players develop the running mechanics that translate to improved on-field speed and agility.
