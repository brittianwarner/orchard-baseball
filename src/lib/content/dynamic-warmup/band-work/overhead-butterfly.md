# Overhead Butterfly, Front to Back

This exercise uses a resistance band to strengthen and stabilize the shoulder complex while improving mobility. The overhead butterfly movement specifically targets the muscles involved in the deceleration phase of the throwing motion.

## Equipment Needed

- Light to medium resistance band (typically color-coded based on resistance level)
- Bands should be approximately 4-5 feet in length

## Execution

1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart in an athletic stance
2. Hold a resistance band with both hands, palms facing down
3. Raise both arms overhead, creating tension in the band
4. Position hands slightly wider than shoulder-width
5. Keeping arms extended, draw hands apart and backward in a butterfly-like motion
6. Control the movement as the band provides resistance
7. Return to the starting position
8. Perform 20 repetitions at a controlled pace

## Purpose

This exercise provides several benefits for baseball players:

- Strengthens the posterior shoulder muscles crucial for throwing
- Improves shoulder joint stability
- Enhances mobility in the shoulder complex
- Targets the rotator cuff muscles in a functional pattern
- Prepares the shoulders for the deceleration phase of throwing
- Reduces risk of shoulder injuries

## Muscle Groups Targeted

- Posterior deltoid
- Infraspinatus and teres minor (rotator cuff muscles)
- Rhomboids
- Middle and lower trapezius
- Latissimus dorsi
- Serratus anterior

## Coaching Points

- Maintain proper posture throughout the exercise
- Keep a slight bend in the elbows to reduce joint stress
- Focus on controlled movement rather than speed
- Ensure the band has appropriate tension (not too loose or tight)
- Breathe rhythmically with the movements
- Keep shoulders down and away from the ears
- Perform the full range of motion while maintaining good form

## Common Mistakes

- Allowing the shoulders to elevate toward the ears
- Using a band with too much resistance
- Moving too quickly through the repetitions
- Insufficient range of motion
- Poor posture (rounded shoulders, forward head)
- Letting the band control the movement rather than the muscles

## Progressions/Variations

- **Resistance Level**: Advance to bands with greater resistance as strength improves
- **Single Arm**: Perform with one arm at a time for increased challenge
- **Speed Variation**: Vary the tempo (slow/controlled vs. quicker/more athletic)
- **Positional Change**: Perform in a half-kneeling or seated position for greater core demand

The overhead butterfly is particularly beneficial for pitchers and players who throw frequently, as it targets the muscles that control the deceleration phase of throwing, which is often a source of shoulder injuries when underdeveloped.
