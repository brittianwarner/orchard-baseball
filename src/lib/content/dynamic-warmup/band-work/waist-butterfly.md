# Butterfly at Waist

The Waist Butterfly exercise uses a resistance band to strengthen the shoulder stabilizers and rotator cuff muscles while in a more functional position. This exercise includes both palm-up and palm-down variations to target different aspects of shoulder function.

## Equipment Needed

- Light to medium resistance band
- Bands should be approximately 4-5 feet in length

## Execution

### Palm Down Variation (20 reps)

1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart in athletic stance
2. Hold the resistance band with both hands at waist level
3. Position hands with palms facing down and pinkies pointing outward
4. Keeping elbows close to the body, draw hands apart laterally
5. Create tension in the band while maintaining external rotation
6. Control the movement as you return to the starting position
7. Perform 20 repetitions with palms down

### Palm Up Variation (20 reps)

1. Maintain the same stance and band position
2. Rotate forearms so palms face upward, maintaining pinky-outward position
3. Draw hands apart laterally while keeping elbows close to the body
4. Focus on external rotation through the movement
5. Control the return to starting position
6. Perform 20 repetitions with palms up

## Purpose

These variations provide several benefits for baseball players:

- Strengthens the rotator cuff muscles in a functional position
- Enhances shoulder stability for throwing and hitting movements
- Targets external rotators critical for proper throwing mechanics
- Improves muscular endurance in the shoulder stabilizers
- Develops both eccentric and concentric control
- Trains the shoulder in multiple positions to enhance functional strength

## Muscle Groups Targeted

- Rotator cuff muscles (particularly infraspinatus and teres minor)
- Posterior deltoid
- Rhomboids
- Middle and lower trapezius
- Biceps brachii (in palm-up variation)
- Serratus anterior

## Coaching Points

- Maintain an upright posture throughout the exercise
- Keep elbows close to the body (avoid flaring)
- Focus on squeezing the shoulder blades together at peak contraction
- Control the movement in both directions (out and in)
- Ensure proper external rotation with pinkies leading the movement
- Maintain consistent tension in the band
- Perform both palm variations with equal focus and control

## Common Mistakes

- Using a band with too much resistance
- Moving too quickly or using momentum
- Losing external rotation during the movement
- Elevating the shoulders toward the ears
- Flaring the elbows away from the body
- Inconsistent tempo or rushing through repetitions
- Rounding the shoulders forward

## Progressions/Variations

- **Single-Arm**: Perform with one arm at a time for increased challenge
- **Stepping Variation**: Add a lateral step with each repetition
- **Resistance Progression**: Increase band resistance as strength improves
- **Isometric Hold**: Add a brief hold at the point of maximum contraction
- **Postural Challenge**: Perform while in a half-kneeling or tall-kneeling position

The combination of palm-up and palm-down variations ensures comprehensive strengthening of the rotator cuff and shoulder stabilizers, which is essential for the overhead throwing athlete. This exercise is particularly beneficial in preventing the common shoulder injuries seen in baseball players.
