# Throwing Arm Statue of Liberty

The Statue of Liberty exercise is a targeted resistance band movement that specifically prepares the throwing arm for the overhead motion used in baseball. This exercise mimics the position and movement pattern of the throwing arm during the acceleration phase.

## Equipment Needed

- Light to medium resistance band
- Bands should be approximately 4-5 feet in length

## Execution

1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart in athletic stance
2. Grasp one end of the resistance band with your throwing hand
3. Hold the other end of the band with your non-throwing hand at waist level
4. Begin with your throwing arm in the "set" position (elbow bent at approximately 90 degrees)
5. Raise your throwing arm to the overhead "Statue of Liberty" position
6. Maintain control against the band's resistance
7. Lower the arm back to the starting position with control
8. Perform 20 controlled repetitions
9. Focus on proper throwing arm mechanics throughout

## Purpose

This exercise provides several key benefits for baseball players:

- Strengthens the specific muscles used in the throwing motion
- Improves shoulder stability in the throwing arm
- Enhances proprioception (body awareness) in the throwing position
- Increases muscular endurance in the rotator cuff
- Develops deceleration control important for arm health
- Prepares the shoulder for the specific demands of throwing
- Reinforces proper throwing arm path

## Muscle Groups Targeted

- Rotator cuff complex (particularly supraspinatus)
- Deltoids (anterior, middle, posterior)
- Triceps brachii
- Trapezius
- Serratus anterior
- Core stabilizers
- Latissimus dorsi

## Coaching Points

- Maintain proper posture throughout the exercise
- Keep the core engaged for trunk stability
- Focus on the correct arm path that mimics throwing
- Control both the raising and lowering phases
- Ensure appropriate band tension throughout the movement
- Keep the non-throwing arm stable at waist level
- Emphasize quality repetitions over speed

## Common Mistakes

- Using a band with excessive resistance
- Moving too quickly through the repetitions
- Poor posture or excessive trunk lean
- Incorrect arm path not specific to throwing
- Wrist deviation during the movement
- Shrugging the shoulders toward the ears
- Allowing momentum to control the movement

## Progressions/Variations

- **Resistance Progression**: Increase band resistance as strength improves
- **Stepping Pattern**: Add a forward step to mimic throwing mechanics
- **Speed Variation**: Gradually increase movement speed to more closely match throwing tempo
- **Follow-Through**: Add a follow-through phase to more completely mimic throwing
- **Deceleration Focus**: Emphasize the lowering phase for improved eccentric control

This exercise is particularly important for pitchers and position players who throw frequently. The Statue of Liberty targets the specific movement pattern and muscles used during the throwing motion, helping to both enhance performance and prevent common throwing-related injuries.
