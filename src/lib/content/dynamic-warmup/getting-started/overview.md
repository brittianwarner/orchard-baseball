# Dynamic Warmup Overview

A proper dynamic warmup is essential for baseball players of all levels. Unlike traditional static stretching, a dynamic warmup uses movement to prepare the body for the specific demands of baseball. This 15-minute routine helps:

- Increase core body temperature and heart rate
- Improve joint mobility and range of motion
- Activate key muscle groups used in baseball
- Enhance neural activation and coordination
- Reduce injury risk
- Prepare mentally for practice or competition

## Why Dynamic Over Static?

Research has shown that dynamic warmups are more effective for performance than static stretching before activity. Dynamic movements:

- Maintain muscle elasticity and power output
- Mimic game-specific movements
- Improve blood flow to working muscles
- Enhance proprioception (body awareness)

## Warmup Structure

Our comprehensive dynamic warmup is divided into several phases:

1. **Getting Started** - Light jogging and team organization
2. **Upper Body** - Arm and shoulder mobility exercises
3. **Band Work** - Resistance exercises for shoulder health and stability including Overhead Butterfly, X Movements, Waist Butterfly, and Statue of Liberty exercises
4. **Lower Body Mobility** - Dynamic stretches from foul line to mound
5. **Speed and Agility** - Graduated intensity running drills
6. **Baseball-Specific Running** - Game situation simulations

Each category contains specific exercises that progressively prepare the body for baseball activities. Follow the subsections on this site to learn the proper technique for each component of the warmup routine.

## Time Requirement

The complete dynamic warmup should take approximately 15 minutes:

- Getting Started: 2 minutes
- Upper Body: 3 minutes
- Band Work: 3 minutes
- Lower Body Mobility: 3 minutes
- Speed and Agility: 2 minutes
- Baseball-Specific Running: 2 minutes

This warmup should be performed before all practices and games to ensure players are properly prepared for baseball activities.
