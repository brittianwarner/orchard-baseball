# Jog Along the Warning Track

Jogging along the warning track is the first component of the dynamic warmup routine, serving as an initial warmup to gradually increase heart rate and prepare the body for more intense activity.

## Execution

1. Players begin at one foul pole in the outfield
2. Jog at a moderate pace along the warning track (the dirt or different-colored track that runs along the outfield fence)
3. Continue jogging to the opposite foul pole
4. Turn around and jog back to the starting position
5. Maintain a steady, comfortable pace throughout

## Purpose

This initial jogging serves several important purposes:

- Gradually increases heart rate
- Elevates core body temperature
- Increases blood flow to muscles
- Loosens up joints and muscles
- Mentally transitions players into practice/game mode
- Provides time for mental preparation

## Coaching Points

- Encourage players to maintain a conversational pace - not too fast or too slow
- Focus on proper running form with relaxed shoulders and arms
- Players should land midfoot, not heavily on heels
- Emphasize the importance of this initial warmup, even if it seems basic
- In cold weather, this phase may be extended
- This is not a sprint or conditioning drill - keep the pace moderate

## Common Mistakes

- Starting too fast
- Taking the jogging too casually (walking instead of jogging)
- Poor running form (hunched shoulders, tense arms)
- Skipping this step on hot days (still essential for muscular preparation)

## Variations

- **Indoor Alternative**: When indoors, jog around the perimeter of the gym or facility
- **Limited Space**: If space is restricted, jog in place or perform small loops
- **Inclement Weather**: Extend indoor warmup activities if field conditions are poor

Players should use this time not only for physical preparation but also to mentally focus on the upcoming practice or game.
