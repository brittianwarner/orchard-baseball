# Side Lunges

Side Lunges (or Lateral Lunges) are a dynamic mobility exercise that targets the adductors, groin, and hip complex in the frontal plane. This exercise is particularly important for baseball players who need multi-directional mobility for fielding and base running.

## Execution

1. Begin at the foul line, standing tall with feet together
2. Take a wide step directly to the side with one leg
3. Bend the stepping leg while keeping the other leg straight
4. Lower your body by sitting back and down into the bent leg
5. Keep the foot of the bent leg pointing forward
6. Push off with the bent leg to return to the starting position
7. Repeat on the opposite side
8. Continue alternating sides while progressing forward

## Purpose

Side lunges provide several key benefits for baseball players:

- Develop lateral mobility in the hips and groin
- Increase flexibility in the adductors (inner thigh muscles)
- Enhance multi-directional movement capacity
- Improve stability during lateral movements
- Prepare the body for the side-to-side demands of fielding
- Strengthen the muscles used in lateral push-off during base running
- Promote better range of motion for fielding ground balls

## Muscle Groups Targeted

- Adductors (adductor magnus, longus, brevis)
- Gluteus medius and minimus
- Quadriceps (particularly vastus lateralis and medialis)
- Hip external rotators
- Core stabilizers
- Tensor fasciae latae (TFL)
- Soleus and gastrocnemius (calves)

## Coaching Points

- Keep the chest up and back straight throughout the movement
- Point toes forward during the entire movement
- Bend the knee in line with the toes (not caving inward)
- Sit back and down rather than forward to engage the glutes
- Keep the straight leg fully extended but not locked
- Push through the heel of the bent leg when returning to center
- Focus on controlled, deliberate movement
- Maintain balance throughout the exercise

## Common Mistakes

- Turning the foot outward instead of keeping it forward
- Insufficient width in the lateral step
- Leaning the torso forward excessively
- Allowing the knee to cave inward
- Inadequate depth in the lunge
- Shifting weight too far over the bent knee
- Moving too quickly and losing control

## Variations

- **Reaching Side Lunge**: Add an arm reach toward the bent knee
- **Alternating Side Lunge**: Alternate sides without returning to center
- **Cross-Behind Side Lunge**: Cross one leg behind the other before lunging
- **Dynamic Side Lunge**: Add a small lateral hop when transitioning
- **Side Lunge with Hold**: Add a 2-3 second hold at the bottom position

Side lunges are essential for baseball players who need to develop lateral agility and strength for movements such as fielding ground balls to the side, making quick directional changes when base running, and creating a stable base during the rotational movements of hitting.
