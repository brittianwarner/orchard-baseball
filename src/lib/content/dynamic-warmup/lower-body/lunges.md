# Lunges (Extended Step and Keep Balance)

Lunges are a fundamental dynamic stretching exercise that develops lower body strength, stability, and mobility. The extended step version specifically enhances the stretching component while challenging balance and control.

## Execution

1. Begin at the foul line, standing tall with good posture
2. Take an extended step forward (longer than a normal walking stride)
3. Lower your body by bending both knees to approximately 90 degrees
4. Keep the front knee aligned over the ankle (not pushing forward past the toes)
5. Maintain an upright torso and good balance
6. Push off the front foot to return to standing
7. Step forward with the opposite leg into another lunge
8. Continue alternating legs while progressing toward the pitcher's mound

## Purpose

This exercise offers numerous benefits for baseball players:

- Develops hip and knee mobility through a functional movement pattern
- Stretches the hip flexors of the rear leg
- Activates and strengthens the quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes
- Enhances balance and stability during unilateral movements
- Improves kinesthetic awareness
- Prepares the lower body for explosive movement patterns
- Mimics the stride motion used in pitching mechanics

## Muscle Groups Targeted

- Quadriceps
- Hamstrings
- Gluteus maximus, medius, and minimus
- Hip flexors (psoas, rectus femoris)
- Adductors
- Core stabilizers
- Soleus and gastrocnemius (calves)

## Coaching Points

- Maintain an upright torso throughout the movement
- Keep the front knee tracking in line with the foot (not caving inward)
- Step far enough forward to create a true stretch and challenge
- Focus on balance and control during the entire movement
- Lower to a depth where both knees approach 90-degree angles
- Keep the weight distributed between both legs
- Look forward, not down, to encourage proper posture
- Breathe naturally throughout the movement

## Common Mistakes

- Front knee extending beyond the toes (increases knee stress)
- Insufficient step length (reduces the stretch component)
- Leaning forward excessively
- Knee caving inward (valgus collapse)
- Poor balance requiring multiple corrections
- Inadequate depth in the lunge position
- Rising up on the toes of the back foot

## Variations

- **Walking Lunges with Reach**: Add an overhead reach or torso rotation
- **Reverse Lunges**: Step backward instead of forward for variation
- **Pulse Lunges**: Add small pulses at the bottom of the lunge position
- **Alternating Depth**: Vary between half and full-depth lunges
- **Progressive Lunges**: Increase step length gradually as the warmup progresses

Lunges are a cornerstone exercise for baseball players, as they develop the unilateral strength and control needed for explosive movements in multiple planes. The extended step version particularly challenges balance, which is essential for fielding, pitching, and batting mechanics.
