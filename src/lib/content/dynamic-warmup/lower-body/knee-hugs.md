# Knee Hugs

Knee Hugs are a dynamic mobility exercise that targets the hip flexors and glutes while activating the core. This exercise helps prepare the lower body for the movement patterns required in baseball.

## Execution

1. Begin at the foul line, standing tall with good posture
2. Step forward with one leg
3. Lift the opposite knee toward the chest
4. Use both hands to gently pull the knee in toward the chest
5. Hold briefly (1-2 seconds) to feel a stretch in the hip
6. Release the knee and step forward with that leg
7. Repeat with the opposite leg
8. Continue alternating legs while walking toward the pitcher's mound
9. Maintain an upright torso throughout the movement

## Purpose

This exercise provides several key benefits for baseball players:

- Activates the hip flexors and core muscles
- Improves hip mobility and flexibility
- Enhances dynamic balance and coordination
- Prepares the lower body for more explosive movements
- Increases blood flow to the hip and core regions
- Promotes proper hip function necessary for running and fielding

## Muscle Groups Targeted

- Hip flexors (iliopsoas)
- Gluteus maximus (stretched position)
- Core stabilizers
- Lower back (erector spinae)
- Hamstrings (stretched position)

## Coaching Points

- Maintain good posture with chest up throughout the movement
- Pull the knee directly toward the chest, not to the side
- Use a gentle pull - this is not a forceful stretch
- Focus on controlled, deliberate movements
- Keep the supporting leg slightly bent for balance
- Ensure equal attention to both legs
- Breathe naturally throughout the exercise

## Common Mistakes

- Leaning too far backward when lifting the knee
- Rounding the shoulders and hunching forward
- Rushing through the movement without control
- Not bringing the knee high enough
- Excessive bouncing when holding the knee
- Taking steps that are too large between repetitions

## Variations

- **Stationary Knee Hugs**: Perform in place for players with balance issues
- **Extended Hold**: Hold each knee for 3-5 seconds for increased mobility
- **Knee Hug with Rotation**: Add a gentle torso rotation when hugging the knee
- **March in Place**: Perform a marching motion rather than walking forward
- **Skip Knee Hugs**: Add a small skip between each knee hug for increased intensity

This exercise is an excellent starting point for the lower body mobility sequence, as it gently activates the hip complex while encouraging proper movement patterns that will be further developed in subsequent exercises.
