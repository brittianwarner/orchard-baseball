# Walking Kick Forward, RDL Back

This dynamic combination exercise pairs a forward leg kick with a Romanian Deadlift (RDL) movement to target the hamstrings through both dynamic and controlled stretching motions.

## Execution

1. Begin at the foul line, standing tall with good posture
2. Kick one leg forward while keeping it straight (not locked)
3. Reach toward the toes of the extended leg with the opposite hand for a slight hamstring stretch
4. Place the extended leg back on the ground
5. Step forward with the opposite leg
6. Perform a single-leg Romanian deadlift (RDL) by hinging at the hips
7. Extend the free leg behind you as you lower your torso parallel to the ground
8. Return to standing position and repeat the sequence on the opposite side
9. Continue alternating sides while progressing toward the pitcher's mound

## Purpose

This exercise offers several important benefits for baseball players:

- Develops hamstring flexibility through both dynamic and static-active stretching
- Improves hip hinge mechanics crucial for power generation
- Enhances single-leg balance and stability
- Strengthens the posterior chain (hamstrings, glutes, lower back)
- Increases coordination between upper and lower body
- Prepares the legs for the demands of explosive baseball movements
- Promotes proper movement patterns for injury prevention

## Muscle Groups Targeted

- Hamstrings (biceps femoris, semitendinosus, semimembranosus)
- Gluteus maximus
- Erector spinae (lower back)
- Core stabilizers
- Hip flexors (during the kicking phase)
- Adductors and abductors (for stability)

## Coaching Points

- Maintain a neutral spine throughout the entire movement
- During the kick phase, keep the leg straight but not locked
- For the RDL, hinge at the hips rather than rounding the back
- Keep the standing leg slightly bent during the RDL portion
- Focus on feeling the hamstring stretch during both components
- Control the movement - this is not a ballistic exercise
- Extend the reaching hand toward the toes without bouncing
- Maintain balance and control throughout the sequence

## Common Mistakes

- Rounding the back during the RDL phase
- Insufficient hip hinge (bending at the knees instead of hinging at hips)
- Kicking too high and sacrificing form
- Failing to keep the raised leg straight during the kick
- Poor balance requiring multiple balance corrections
- Moving too quickly through the sequence
- Inadequate range of motion during the RDL phase

## Variations

- **Stationary Version**: Perform in place for players with balance issues
- **Increased Range**: Progressive increase in kick height as flexibility improves
- **Added Balance Challenge**: Pause for 2-3 seconds during the RDL position
- **Hand Position Variation**: Place both hands on the standing leg during the RDL
- **Partner RDL**: Partner provides light resistance during the RDL phase for advanced players

This exercise is particularly valuable for baseball players as it develops the hamstring flexibility and strength needed for explosive movements like sprinting, and teaches proper hip hinge mechanics which translate to improved power production in hitting and throwing.
