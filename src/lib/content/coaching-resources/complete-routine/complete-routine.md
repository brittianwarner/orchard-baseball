- **Observation**: Watch players for proper form and make corrections as needed
- **Progression**: Ensure exercises build in intensity throughout the warmup
- **Consistency**: Perform this routine before every practice and game
- **Adaptability**: Adjust timing based on weather conditions (longer in cold weather)
- **Safety First**: If any player experiences pain (not muscle fatigue), they should notify a coach

## Weather Considerations

- **Cold Weather**: Extend jogging and upper body phases; add extra layers during initial phases
- **Hot Weather**: Ensure players are hydrated before beginning; include water breaks
- **Wet Conditions**: Modify or eliminate exercises that might be dangerous on slippery surfaces
