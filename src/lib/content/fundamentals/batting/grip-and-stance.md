# Proper Grip and Stance for Baseball Batting

The foundation of a good batting technique starts with how you hold the bat and position your body. Mastering these fundamentals will significantly improve your hitting performance.

## The Grip

A proper grip provides control, power, and quick bat movement:

1. **Hand Position**:

   - Hold the bat with both hands, with your dominant hand above your non-dominant hand
   - Your hands should be close together but not overlapping
   - For right-handed batters: left hand on bottom, right hand on top
   - For left-handed batters: right hand on bottom, left hand on top

2. **Grip Tightness**:

   - The grip should be firm but not tight - imagine holding a small bird
   - Your bottom hand controls the bat, while your top hand guides it
   - Avoid gripping too tightly, which restricts wrist movement and reduces bat speed

3. **Knuckle Alignment**:
   - Align the middle knuckles of your hands (the "door-knocking" knuckles)
   - This creates proper wrist action and bat control

## The Stance

Your stance is your foundation and sets you up for a successful swing:

1. **Foot Position**:

   - Stand with feet shoulder-width apart or slightly wider
   - Weight distributed evenly on the balls of your feet
   - Front foot slightly open (pointed slightly toward the pitcher)
   - Back foot parallel to the plate or slightly closed

2. **Weight Distribution**:

   - 60% of weight on your back leg
   - 40% on your front leg
   - Knees slightly bent, creating athletic tension

3. **Body Position**:

   - Shoulders level and relaxed
   - Head level with eyes focused on the pitcher
   - Spine relatively straight but with a slight tilt toward the plate

4. **Bat Position**:
   - Hold the bat at a 45-degree angle
   - Keep it off your shoulder
   - Position it slightly behind your back ear

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. Gripping the bat too tightly
2. Standing too upright or rigid
3. Positioning feet too close together or too wide
4. Holding the bat too low or too high
5. Locking your front elbow

## Practice Drill: Mirror Work

Stand in front of a mirror and practice your grip and stance. Check for:

- Proper hand placement
- Correct knuckle alignment
- Athletic body position
- Weight distribution
- Relaxed shoulders

Practice this stance daily until it becomes second nature. Remember, a solid grip and stance provide the foundation for everything that follows in your swing.
