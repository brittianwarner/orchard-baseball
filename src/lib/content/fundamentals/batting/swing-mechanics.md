# Baseball Swing Mechanics

Developing a powerful and consistent swing is essential for success at the plate. This guide covers the key components of proper swing mechanics.

## The Swing Sequence

A proper baseball swing consists of several connected movements that work together:

1. **Stance and Load**

   - From your balanced stance, shift your weight slightly back
   - Create a small coil with your upper body
   - Keep your hands relaxed and in a good launch position

2. **Stride and Weight Transfer**

   - Take a short, controlled stride toward the pitcher
   - Keep your stride foot closed until rotation begins
   - Begin transferring weight from back to front

3. **Hip Rotation**

   - Initiate the swing with your lower body
   - Rotate your hips explosively toward the pitcher
   - Create torque by maintaining upper body tension while hips begin to turn

4. **Torso Rotation**

   - Allow hip rotation to pull your torso through
   - Keep your back elbow close to your body
   - Maintain a slight upward angle with your shoulder plane

5. **Hand Path and Extension**
   - Keep hands inside the ball
   - Take the shortest path to the contact point
   - Extend arms through contact, not before
   - Follow through with full extension after contact

## Common Swing Flaws

1. **Casting the Hands**

   - Swinging hands away from body too early
   - Creates long swing path and reduces power
   - Fix: Keep hands inside and take direct path to ball

2. **Dropping the Hands**

   - Lowering hands during swing initiation
   - Creates an uppercut and increases miss chance
   - Fix: Maintain hand position during load and stride

3. **Rolling Over**

   - Turning hands too early, resulting in weak grounders
   - Often caused by pulling the front shoulder out
   - Fix: Stay "through" the baseball and finish high

4. **Lunging**
   - Shifting weight too far forward before swing
   - Causes loss of power and balance
   - Fix: Controlled stride with weight mostly back until rotation

## Drills to Improve Swing Mechanics

1. **Tee Drills**

   - Place ball on tee at different heights and locations
   - Focus on proper mechanics for each position
   - Hit 20-30 balls daily, focusing on contact quality

2. **Soft Toss**

   - Have a partner toss balls from the side
   - Focus on keeping hands inside and driving through ball
   - Vary speeds and locations

3. **One-Handed Swings**

   - Practice swinging with just your top hand, then just bottom hand
   - Develops proper hand path and wrist action
   - 10-15 swings per hand

4. **Resistance Band Swings**
   - Attach resistance band to bat or hands
   - Swing against resistance to build strength in correct swing path
   - 10-15 controlled swings

Remember that a great swing comes from consistent practice with proper mechanics. Break down your swing into components, fix one issue at a time, and build muscle memory through repetition.
